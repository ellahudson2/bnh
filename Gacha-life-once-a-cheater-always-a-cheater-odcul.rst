Some people believe that a leopard does not change its spot, which literally means that once a cheater, always a cheater. Yes there are plenty of serial cheaters –individuals who never take any relationship serious. Once a cheater always a cheater isn’t true for everyone. Some cheaters learn from their mistakes and remain faithful for the rest of their lives. Those that change the way they act are few and far between according to some sources. Statistics show that it is more likely for a person to cheat once they have cheated before.
