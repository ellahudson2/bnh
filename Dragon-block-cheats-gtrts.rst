 · In Dragon Blox, players can create their characters to go on Adventures while training themselves to fight the enemies and become the ultimate warrior. Now, it can take a long time to achieve this. Wiki -> Dragon Block C -> Commands. Command Function “/jrmctp (amount) [playerName]” add Training Points “/jrmca (Set or Add) (Attribute or All) (Amount or Max) [playerName]” change attributes you can set or add points to attributes where Attribute can be Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Willpower, Mind, Concentration.  · Update as of 1/1/ I have returned, was never expecting this many views. Looks like new commands have been added and noticed the quality wasn't that grea.
