While you're in game press 'Esc' on your keyboard to open up the PPSSPP interface and select Cheats from this window. Select 'Edit Cheat File' on the next screen and the PPSSPP will auto generate a file for your game and open it up. You can usually find this file in the memstick folder of your PPSSPP directory.  · In this video, I show you how to use cheats or cheat codes with PPSSPP, Im using a Windows PC in the video but it is the same method on other platforms like Missing: gold. Here’s how to do that: First, you have to enable cheats in the game. To the left of the map list, you will see the “Cheats” option. Select a single-player mode and click “Play” again.
